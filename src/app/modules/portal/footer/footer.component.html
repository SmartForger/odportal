                                <p>As the Baltimore Sun points out, the segment was taped before the Ravens were knocked out
                                    of the postseason and the full episode aired Tuesday night. "Inside the NFL" teased the
                                    segment Monday night on Twitter with a video clip, which showed Lewis and Jackson discussing
